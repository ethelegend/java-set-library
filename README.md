### FOR MATH NERD EYES ONLY
Welcome to my first proper project! This is a lightweight Java class designed to facilitate math operations in sets above the real numbers.
Currently runs as quaternion numbers, and by extension supports complex and real numbers.
Don't expect this to update fast because I'm having to teach myself about quaternions to make this.
-
Current supported functions:
- Modulus
- Conjugate
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
To-Do:
- Inverse
- Dot product
- Cross product
